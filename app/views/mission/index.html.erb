    The brain controls the body, but the body needs exercise to maintain and improve the brain. We created MWC because there is a large need for social and affordable fitness classes for people living with mental illness. Exercise helps regulate emotional moods and is a natural anti-depressant.

    We want to help give your brain a boost, naturally.

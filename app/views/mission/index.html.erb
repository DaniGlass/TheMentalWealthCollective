  <h1>About</h1>
  <div class="content">
    The brain controls the body, but the body needs exercise to maintain and improve the brain. We created MWC because there is a large need for social and affordable fitness classes â€“ especially for people living with a mental illness. Exercise helps regulate emotional moods and is a natural anti-depressant.
